1 login to OSU vpn using Cisco Anyconnect (full tunnel / partial tunnel)

2 SSH (secure shell) into College of Engineering FLIP server (using PUTTY)
 - in PUTTY:  "flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu" for Host Name/IP
 
3 from within your OSU engineering space on GITHUB:
 run command:
    git clone https://github.com/luyaozh/CS290.git ./
    to copy files from class GIT repository to your own.
	- MIND THE DIRECTORY NAME
 
4.  *a* there is a file called dbcon.js.template. Rename this to dbcon.js
    - note:  you need to be in $PROJECT/diagnostic/ , where $PROJECT is where git clone was run
	- edit the file thus:
	var mysql = require('mysql');
	var pool = mysql.createPool({
	  connectionLimit : 10,
	  host            : 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu',
	  user            : '[cs290_yourengrusername]',
	  password        : '[last-4-digits-of-your-osu-id-number]',
	  database        : '[cs290_yourengrusername]'
	});

	module.exports.pool = pool;
					
    *** e.g.:   ****************  
		var mysql = require('mysql');
		var pool = mysql.createPool({
		  connectionLimit : 10,
		  host            : 'classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu',
		  user            : 'cs290_smithj',
		  password        : '1234',
		  database        : 'cs290_smithj'
		});

		module.exports.pool = pool;
    ***************************************\
	Your flip account may need to manually install Express, Express-handlebars, 
	mysql if you have not done it before. Under the diagnostic folder, run 
	*********
	npm install express
	npm install express-handlebars
	npm install mysql
	****
	will install these for you.
	
	*b*
	
	changing MYSQL password:
	In this step, you may want to change your MySQL password to be something other than the last 4 digits of your ID
	to make it more secure. You can skip this step if you just want to use the default password. 
	Yu can access the administration panel at https://classmysql.engr.oregonstate.edu/ Links to an external site.
	where you can change your password. Please use "cs290_your ONID user name" as user name and the last 
	four digits of your OSU ID number as the initial db password, and choose server name 'classmysql'. 
	This site can only be accessed while you are VPNed into the OSU network. Note that if you change the password,
	you need to make the change in the dbcon.js as well. This can also be useful for troubleshooting database
	problems as it is a graphical interface that will let you inspect the contents of your database when 
	you might otherwise be unable to access it. If you forget the password after you change it, please 
	email the IT support and they will reset to the default.

	Since this is running on a shared machine, everyone cannot use port 3000.
	If you look at the diagnostic.js file you will see that the port 3000 was replaced with 
	process.argv[2]. This means it will take the argument immediately after the filename when 
	you start Node.js and use that as the port. So running node diagnostic.js 5345 will start 
	node running on port 5345. Everyone will need to use a unique port otherwise you will get
	an error that the port is in use. Try a number between 3000 and 65535 till you find one that 
	works for you (Hint: Try some random permutation of the last 4 or 5 digits of your OSU ID).

	Finally is the topic of persistence. If you want to use forever there will be a few changes. 
	You need to install it on a per application basis. So to install it for the diagnostic folder, 
	navigate to in that folder and run npm install forever. Note that this does not use the global flag.

    Then you will need to run forever by accessing the forever binary directly. 
	So from within the diagnostic directory you would run forever using the command 
	./node_modules/forever/bin/forever. So when before you would run forever start diagnostic.js, now you will run
	./node_modules/forever/bin/forever start diagnostic.js 5345. So we specify the path to the forever binary and 
	also add a port number as an argument. 
	You could view the page being served by visiting http://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:5345 while you are VPNed into the OSU network.
	
	7
	
	And as a closing note, if you log into access.engr.oregonstate.edu you will randomly be put on 
	flip1, flip2 or flip3. You can see which flip you are using the command hostname then you can 
	switch flips by using the command ssh flipX where X is 1, 2 or 3. You need to be sure to log into 
	the same flip every time because the node instance will only be running on one of them. So if you
	ever run forever list and don't see your instance running it means you are probably on the wrong flip.
